# Config Test

<!-- below are todos taken from config/readme.md to keep the readme.md clean -->

<!-- > Some things like config file symlinking, alfred, KM macros moving is not yet documented/fully-shared but will be soon. -->

<!-- TODO: do above! -->

<!-- TODO: fix below. needs updating and is broken, I need to write a cleaner sync up approach -->

<!-- Take a look at [install](install) shell script. It will install [brew](https://brew.sh), [go](https://go.dev) & [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage).

Run it with `./install`. As part of the script it will run `mage setup`. Take a look at [magefile.go](magefile.go) `Setup` function to see what it will do.

You can also run `mage` alone to see what commands you can run with descriptions of them.

In short, it will create appropriate symlinks pointing at files in `~/.dotfiles`. It is assumed that the dotfiles repo is placed there.

It will also install CLI tools & apps.

5. [Sync settings](https://github.com/zenangst/Syncalicious) for apps I use. -->

<!-- TODO: Syncalicious looks neat, try use and test it works -->

<!-- TODO: mention [~/bin](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/bin) -->

<!-- TODO: link `CLIs` to wiki where it shows all the CLIs I have installed with descriptions or to file here that I parse with CLI of my own (fuzzy search command + what command/CLI does) (fish functions / CLIs / builtins / ..) (JSON?) -->

<!-- TODO: maybe do same for `apps`, can have list of all apps installed + location from where to install the app -->

<!-- TODO: make [apps] and [CLIs] hyperlinks, for now it's broken/outdated thus removed -->

<!-- TODO: add other apps -->

<!-- ## WatchOS

I stopped wearing a watch. But when I did I mostly used it to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.

I used only one Infograph Modular watch face. It showed the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also let me quickly start cardio workout (running/biking) or bodyweight workout (with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com)). I could also start a timer or see the time of a timer if one is already running. -->

<!-- ## iPad

I don't use iPad either. When I did, I mostly used it to draw with [Procreate](https://procreate.art) or noting/sketching in [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes)/[Muse](https://museapp.com/) with the pencil. I also sometimes used it as second screen with [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT210380).
